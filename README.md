This project demonstrates how to perform sentiment analysis (classifying text as positive or negative) using a pre-trained model from Hugging Face Transformers.
It uses the pipeline API, which makes it super easy to load pre-trained models for tasks like text classification, translation, summarization, and more.
Features:
Uses a pre-trained sentiment analysis model (no training required).
Classifies input text into labels like POSITIVE or NEGATIVE.
Shows confidence scores for each prediction.
Simple and lightweight (only a few lines of code).
